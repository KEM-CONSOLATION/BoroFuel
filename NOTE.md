Subject: Update on New Driver Verification Feature Implemented

Hello App Review Team,

Thank you for your continued guidance during the review process. As part of our effort to strengthen access control and ensure that the app is used strictly by verified drivers belonging to our partner organizations, we have implemented an additional verification feature in the latest build.

New Feature Added: Organization ID Verification After Login

After successfully logging in, drivers must now enter their Organization ID Number, which is cross-checked against a verified list of ID numbers supplied directly by our partner companies.

These ID numbers belong to official drivers registered by each organization.

Without a valid Organization ID Number, the user cannot proceed to any operational features inside the app.

This ensures that only individuals who are vetted and confirmed by a registered partner organization can access the internal workflow.

Periodic & Random Verification Logic

To further enhance security and accountability, the system now performs periodic and random re-verification of the Organization ID Number for drivers who are actively performing certain actions inside the app.

This means that even after initial login:

Drivers may be prompted at random intervals to re-verify their Organization ID.

This helps us ensure that the user currently performing fuel requests or operations is still officially linked to the partnering company.

Any mismatch or invalid ID immediately revokes access to restricted features.

This mechanism significantly strengthens internal compliance, prevents unauthorized use, and ensures that the app remains strictly aligned with our partner organizations’ operational requirements.

Test ID for Review Team

For your convenience, we have provided a sample Organization ID that you can use to experience this verification flow during testing:

Test Organization ID: BF-DRIVER-2219

Entering this ID after login will allow you to pass the verification step and access the functional sections of the app for review purposes.

If there is any additional information or further clarification you need regarding this new feature, we are happy to provide it.

Thank you again for your time and support.

Best regards,
Borofuel

Borofuel is a fuel access and station-partner app that connects approved drivers with designated filling stations for seamless fuel collection.

The app is designed for transport associations and their registered drivers. Drivers visit any approved partner filling station, authenticate their membership, and receive fuel according to the association’s existing arrangements with the station.

No cash is provided and no personal lending activity takes place.
Drivers simply settle their fuel usage through their association’s normal operational process, as managed internally by the association.
